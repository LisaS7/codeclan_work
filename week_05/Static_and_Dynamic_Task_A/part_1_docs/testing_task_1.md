### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.

# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.:
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc.

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer.

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    # == required for equality check
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    # else should have colon
    else
      return False

# typo: should be def instead of dif
# code not indented within function
# card1 and card2 should have comma in between
# method will return card2 if the cards have the same value
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    # there's no card variable in this function. should probably be card1.
    return card
  else:
    return card2


# not indented within class
def cards_total(self, cards):
  # variable should be assigned a value, e.g. total = 0
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    # can't add int to string - total will need to be a string
    # should have a space after "of"
    # return indentation should be in line with "for"
    return "You have a total of" + total

```
