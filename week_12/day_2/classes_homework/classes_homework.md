# Homework

Create your own library class with an internal collection of books.

## MVP
* Books should have a title, author and genre.
* A Library should have an ArrayList of Books.
* Write a method to count the number of books in the library.
* Write a method to add a book to the library stock.
* Write a method that takes a title and returns true if the Library has a book with the same title and false if not.

## Extension
* The library wants to keep track of it's number of books by genre. Using a HashMap, store the genre of each book as the key - and a count of how many books of that genre as the value.
