# Responsive Web App

You’ve been asked to develop a responsive website for a clothing retailer.

The retailer sells six different categories of clothes: women’s footwear, men’s footwear, women’s casualwear, men’s casualwear, women’s formalwear and man’s formalwear.

The page that you develop should display all of the available products, as well as a shopping cart to which they can be added.

The products available are:

- £5.00 off your order
- £10.00 off when you spend over £50.00
- £15.00 off when you have bought at least one footwear item and spent over £75.00

The prioritised list of user stories is as follows:

1. As a User I can view the products and their category, price and availability information.
2. As a User I can add a product to my shoppingcart.
3. As a User I can remove a product from my shopping cart.
4. As a User I can view the total price for the products in my shopping cart.
5. As a User I can apply a voucher to my shopping cart.
6. As a User I can view the total price for the products in my shopping cartswith discounts applied.
7. As a User I am alerted when I apply an invalid voucher to my shopping cart.
8. As a User I am unable to add Out of Stock products to the shopping cart.


## Test Criteria

We will use this test to assess how well you write code. There is no right or wrong answer. Functional correctness is important, but we will assess your solution holistically.

You should tackle as many of the user stories as you can in priority order. We expect you to spend approximately three hours on this but there is no strict time limit.
There is no restriction on using third party libraries. You may use any technology you feel is appropriate.

You should also feel free to use mocks as appropriate, e.g. you can store product data in a flat file or in a constant, rather than create a database. Please isolate mocked data or services as appropriate.

You will be assessed on the quality of your code, functional correctness and your approach to quality assurance and testing.

Please provide your code in a format that we can build and run on a Mac, e.g. a zip file with the appropriate HTML, CSS and JavaScript resources.

Please include a README file that describes how to build and run the code, and the code layout at a high level to help us understand where to look. Feel free to also describe your approach and your thinking.
